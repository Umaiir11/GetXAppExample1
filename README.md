# getxapp

This is a simple conceptual application created using GetX, 
a lightweight and powerful state management library for Flutter.
The app uses the MVVM architecture pattern and incorporates two-way data binding, GetX States,
and other features of the GetX library.

The app contains two screens,
the first of which displays two lists that are dynamically updated using the GetX States.
The second screen contains two containers and two sliders,
which allow the user to change the color of the containers through the use of GetX States.

The project includes two views and two view models,
which work together to enable efficient and dynamic state management.
This app is a great example of how to utilize the GetX library to create powerful, responsive, and user-friendly Flutter applications.
